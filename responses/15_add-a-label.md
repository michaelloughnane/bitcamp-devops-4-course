# Trigger all the things ðŸŽ‰

Let's trigger your new workflow! Add a label to this pull request, it can be any label you choose.

After adding a label head over to your [Actions tab]({{actionsUrl}}) if you want to watch the workflow.

Once your workflow has completed check your [issues tab]({{repoUrl}}/issues) and you should see a new issue with a hilarious joke as the body!

Continue experimenting with this workflow for as long as you'd like.

Try adding another label and see if you get a new joke!

---

When you have finished experimenting, merge this pull request. I'll open a new issue containing the next steps once I detect you've closed this.
