## On to your development environment

@{{user.login}} our JavaScript actions are going to leverage the [GitHub ToolKit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit) for developing GitHub Actions.

This is an external library that we will install using `npm` which means that you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

I find writing actions to be easier from a local environment vs trying to do everything right here in the repository. Doing these steps locally allows you to use the editor of your choice so that you have all the extensions and snippets you are used to when writing code.

If you do not have a preferred environment then I suggest following along with me exactly as you see on the screen, which means you'll need to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Don't forget to set up your workstation ðŸ˜‰

Most of your work going forward will take place away from your Learning Lab repository, so before continuing with the course ensure you have the following installed on your **local machine**.

1. [ ] [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. [ ] [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your editor of choice
3. [ ] [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### :keyboard: Activity: Initialize a new JavaScript project

Once you have the necessary tools installed locally, follow these steps to begin creating your first action.

1. Open the **Terminal** (Mac and Linux) or **Command Prompt** (Windows) on your local machine
2. Clone your Learning Lab repo to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone {{repoUrl}}.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the folder you just cloned:
   ```shell
   cd {{ repo }}
   ```
4. Create a new branch named `hello-world`. This is the branch we will use to write our first action. **Please do not capitalize letters unless I do, I run case-sensitive checks to make sure I can help you along the way!**
   ```shell
   git checkout -b hello-world
   ```

5. Create a new folder for our actions files:
   ```shell
   mkdir -p .github/actions/hello-world
   ```
6. Navigate to the `hello-world` folder you just created:
   ```shell
   cd .github/actions/hello-world
   ```
7. Initialize a new project:
   ```shell
   npm init -y
   ```
8. Install the **core** dependency from the [GitHub ToolKit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit):
   ```shell
   npm install --save @actions/core
   ```
9. Commit those newly added files,we will remove the need to upload **node_modules** in a later step:
   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m 'add project dependencies'
   ```
10. Push your changes to your repository:
    ```shell
    git push -u origin hello-world
    ```

I will respond once you have finished.
