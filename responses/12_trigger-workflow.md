## {{user.login}} get ready to laugh

Great job! Everything is all set up and now we are ready to start laughing ðŸ¤£. You will find you have some joke related labels available to you in this repository. You don't have to use them, any label will trigger our workflow, but it might be easier to follow along with me if you use the labels I suggest.

### :keyboard: Trigger a joke

1. Apply the `first-joke` label to this pull request
2. Wait a few seconds and then apply the `second-joke` label to this pull request
3. Check the workflow results on the [Actions tab]({{actionsUrl}})

---

Feel free to continue adding labels to this pull request if you want to see more jokes.

When you are ready to move forward in the lesson merge this pull request into the `master` branch.
