Please ensure that on this branch, you've taken the following steps:

```shell
# 1. Created a folder with the name: .github/actions/issue-maker
mkdir -p .github/actions/issue-maker
cd .github/actions/issue-maker

# 2. Inside the new folder, initialized it as a Node.js project:
npm init -y

# 3. Installed the core AND github dependencies from the GitHub Actions Toolkit:
npm install --save @actions/core @actions/github

# 4. Staged, committed, and pushed all the files that were generated as a result:
git add .
git commit -m 'add issue maker dependencies'
git push
```

This will generate a number of files, but I'm spot checking that:
- the following file exists: `.github/actions/issue-maker/package.json`
- that it contains the core and github dependency from the GitHub Actions Toolkit  (note: I'm not paying attention to the version number):
    ```
    "dependencies": {
      "@actions/core": "^1.2.3",
      "@actions/github": "^2.1.1"
    }
    ```
