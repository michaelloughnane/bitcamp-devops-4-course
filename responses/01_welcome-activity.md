## Configuring a workflow

Actions are enabled on your repository by default, but we still have to tell our repository to use them. We do this by creating a workflow file in our repository.

A **workflow** file can be thought of as the recipe for automating a task. They house the start to finish instructions, in the form of `jobs` and `steps`, for what should happen based on specific triggers.

Your repository can contain multiple **workflow** files that carry out a wide variety of tasks. It is important to consider this when deciding on a name for your **workflow**. The name you choose should reflect the tasks being performed.

_In our case, we will use this one **workflow** file for many things, which leads us to break this convention for teaching purposes._
