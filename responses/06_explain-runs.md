## Runs

As you have learned `runs:` defines the command necessary to execute your action.

In our current case `runs:` takes 2 arguments

- `using:`
- `main:`

These are specific to JavaScript actions. It is our way of telling the runner to run the `main.js` file using `node12`

This is no different than running a local JavaScript file using Node like you see below:

Which means that the value of `main:` would be different if your file was not named `main.js`.

In this scenario our metadata block would look like this:

```yaml
runs:
  using: "node12"
  main: "bread.js"
```

#### From our workflows perspective

This execution is visible from within your workflow. To save time I have included a screenshot of what your workflow currently looks like. As always, you can follow along in the [Actions tab]({{actionUrl}}).

Look ðŸ‘€, now we have a new error! We are totally making progress here! What we can reason from this output is that our `action.yml` file was found and read. Since we defined the `main:` parameter to point to a file named `main.js` the workflow looked for that file in the root of the `hello-world` directory, but since it couldn't find it the workflow fails.

Let's fix this next!
