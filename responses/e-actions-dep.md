Please ensure that on your `hello-world` branch, you've taken the following steps:

```shell
# 1. Created a folder with the name: .github/actions/hello-world
mkdir -p .github/actions/hello-world
cd .github/actions/hello-world

# 2. Inside the new folder, initialized it as a Node.js project:
npm init -y

# 3. Installed the core dependency from the GitHub Actions Toolkit:
npm install --save @actions/core

# 4. Staged, committed, and pushed all the files that were generated as a result:
git add .
git commit -m 'initial hello-world'
git push -u origin hello-world
```

This will generate a number of files, but I'm spot checking that:
- the following file exists: `.github/actions/hello-world/package.json`
- that it contains the core dependency from the GitHub Actions Toolkit (note: I'm not paying attention to the version number):
    ```
    "dependencies": {
      "@actions/core": "^1.2.1"
    }
    ```
